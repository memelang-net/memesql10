These files are LLM training data for a DSL query language. Create new training data for a new schema.
* Output in markdown box as `""" user natural language query """\nMEMELANG\n\n`
* Each comment is a user's natural language search query. 
	* Phrase each distinctly - do not repeat a pattern
	* Phrase concisely - never use superfluous phrases like "Give," "Return," or "List."
	* Phrase humanly - never use program instructions, never use phrases like "capture," "remember," or "bind"
	* Never use "table.column"
	* Use only ASCII characters
	* Use only exampled rules - never invent new rules
	* Use only exampled syntax - never invent new syntax
	* Use only absolute dates - never use relative dates
	* Avoid terms that could trigger a warning like "die" or "dead"

Create the following examples for the schema. Output in markdown box as `""" user natural language query """\nMEMELANG\n\n`.
* for each table, 3 examples that each select all columns
* for each table, for each column, 3 examples that each filter on just that column
	* use < > >= <= ~ <=> !~ != = where applicable
* for each table, for each column, 3 examples that each filter on just that column using TWO values such as =X,Y or !=X,Y or ~X,Y or !=X,Y


Now create the following examples for the schema. Output in markdown box as `""" user natural language query """\nMEMELANG\n\n`.
* for each table, for each column, 3 examples that sort asc on just that column
* for each table, for each column, 3 examples that sort asc on just that column
* for each table, 6 examples that sort on 2-3 columns, mixing :asc and :des
* for each table, for each int/date/dec column, 2 examples filter that column twice as col >=X;<=Y
* for each table, 4 examples that filter on 2-4 columns
* for each table, 2 examples that filter on 2-4 columns and sort on one column
* for each table, 4 examples that filter on 2-4 columns and sort on one column with a `;%m;lim X`
* for each table, 4 examples that filter on 2-4 columns and sort on one column with a` ;%m;lim X;beg Y`


Now create the following examples for the schema. Output in markdown box as `""" user natural language query """\nMEMELANG\n\n`.
* 10 examples using :grp for distinct
	* use non-unique columns
* 10 examples using :sum and :grp
* 10 examples using :min and :grp
* 10 examples using :max and :grp
* 10 examples using :avg and :grp
* 10 examples using :cnt and :grp


Now create the following examples for the schema. Output in markdown box as `""" user natural language query """\nMEMELANG\n\n`.
* 10 examples using :cnt|sum|min|max|avg and :grp and a filter column
* 10 examples using group-filter :grp[<|>|=|!=|~|!~|<=>]X with a :cnt|sum|min|max|avg
* 10 examples using group :grp and a filter on :cnt|sum|min|max|avg<>=X
* 10 examples using group-filter-sort :grp:asc|des[<|>|=|!=|~|!~|<=>]X with a :cnt|sum|min|max|avg
* 10 examples using group :grp and a filter-sort on :cnt|sum|min|max|avg:asc|des<>=X
* 10 join examples using @, projecting two column value not available in one table


Now create the following examples for the schema. Output in markdown box as `""" user natural language query """\nMEMELANG\n\n`.
* 20 multi-hop join examples
* 20 examples that include :cnt|sum|min|max|avg and :grp and :asc|des and a filter and an @ join
* 20 examples that assign a variable :$x[!=|~|!~|>|<|>=|<=] to an unknown value, then join _ to @, then reference the variable as col $x or col !$x.
